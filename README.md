# Trie Tree in JAVA
This project is an implementation of a Trie Tree (prefix tree) in JAVA
## Explanation
- This data structure is optimized to save strings and words as characters. Each character is saved in one node, which the prefix of the word is the ancestors of the node, and the suffix of the word is the descendants of the node
- The Trie.java and TrieNode.java both are the main componenets of the data structure, the rest are only helper classes
- The tree checks if the word is in the dictionary.txt file before adding it, thus, it is scanned when the Interface.java runs
## Achnowledgment
- Helper classes have been provided by the instructors
## Usage
1. Run Interface.java
2. Wait until the dictionary.txt is fully scanned
3. Choose one of the options. The options are described in the Documentation.pdf file
