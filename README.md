# Trie Tree in JAVA
This project is an implementation of a prefix tree in JAVA
## Explanation
- This data structure is optimized to save strings as words
- The Trie.java and TrieNode.java both are the main componenets of the data structure, the rest are only helper classes
- The tree checks if the word is in the dictionary.txt file before adding it, thus, it is scanned when the Interface.java runs.
## Achnowledgment
- Helper classes have been provided by the instructors
## Usage
1. Run Interface.java
2. Wait until the dictionary.txt is fully scanned
3. Choose one of the options. The options are described in the Documentation.pdf file
